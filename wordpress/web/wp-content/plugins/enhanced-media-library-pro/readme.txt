## Description ##

The plugin will be handy for those who need to manage a lot of media files.


### Categorize by Anything! ###

* Unlimited **categories & tags** for media items
* Unlimited **custom taxonomies:** create in a few clicks
* Unlimited **third-party taxonomies:** assign to the media library


### Configurable Filters ### 

* **Show / hide** data, author, taxonomy filters
* **Per taxonomy** filters
* **Configurable outcome** of the filtering: include / exclude child categories


### Enhanced Media Library ###

* **Show captions:** title, filename, or caption field for each media item
* **Bulk selection:** no special mode anymore, faster editing
* **Drag'n'Drop re-order** right in the media library


### Dynamic Galleries / Playlists ###

Additional parameters for the [gallery] and [playlist] shortcodes:

* `media_category` or any other taxonomy
* `monthnum`
* `year`
* `limit` of media items to show


### MIME Types Management ###

Add or remove file types, allow or disallow uploading. The plugin incorporates a file type into media filters if you wish.


### Feels Native to WordPress ###

We spent hours to make Enhanced Media Library operates as though it were native WordPress functionality. All plugin features are incorporated into WordPress UI seamlessly.


### Developer-Friendly ###

* **Core hooks just work** for media taxonomies and media items
* **All taxonomies supported:** custom and code-registered
* **REST API supported** out of the box
* **No custom tables** in the database
* **Deactivation makes no harm to data:** all media items and taxonomies remain after deactivation


### Export / Import / Restore Plugin Settings ###

If you need to move your media library to another website you should export and import WordPress content with WordPress built-in export/import. But to make the Enhanced Media Library work on the new site with the same settings you are provided with the export/import feature.


### Multisite compatible ###

Network activate the plugin and choose which options will be available to your admins. In the PRO version, the license key should be activated once for the whole network.

* **Unlimited & Super-Fast** Bulk Edit
* **User-friendly** dynamic galleries / playlists: all options set with dropdowns and checkboxes, no "coding"
* **Advanced search:** filter media items by just typing the first letters of its name in the search field
* **Auto-Categorize** for post media items

### Incompatibility ###

Please notice that you use Enhanced Media Library with other plugins that add media categories, media folders, or manage MIME Types at your own risk. We cannot guarantee their compatibility because of the different approaches to the same functionality. We do not recommend using other media library (folder) plugin at the same time with the Enhanced Media Library. Please choose the one you prefer.
